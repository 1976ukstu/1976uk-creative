Massive night last night with getting 2 dashboards working 

We are at the point where i can show poeple a working dashboard that will update images on their wordpress websites without going through the wordpress admin 

This was exctly my idea and to see it coming to life is emence for me - well done everybody!!

Ideas going forward

1. This is for the Gallery page - If we can make the lightbox work for the images on the Gallery page. We can use the exact same system we used for Dragicas Galleries. This is to be discussed first as there are probably better solutions for the lightbox now and i am open to ideas on this

Dashboard now - 

2. Once entered the dashboard we have the 6 cards displayed identical to Gallery page - Done✅

3. On the Dashboard cards we have 2 bottons, one called Edit and one called Preview - Done✅

4. Edit button to open a lightbox with controls - 

    Image Enhancement - yes please in dashboard

    Built-in filters (brightness, contrast, saturation) - yes please in dashboard
    Auto-optimization for web - yes please in dashboard
    Multiple image sizes/formats - yes please in dashboard
    A crop function? not sure if this is possible as i guess it would have to make a copy maybe?

The above would be totally amazing if doable? 

Then there would have to be a publish or save as image button?

5. Preview button to also open a lightbox with how the image will look on the Gallery page?

    🔥 Advanced Features:
    Live Gallery Preview - yes please as a lightbox the same as Dragicas lightbox if possible?

    Split-screen: dashboard editing on left, live gallery on right
    Instant preview of changes without page refresh 
    Card Reordering - yes please in dashboard or on Preview lightbox we could have an order button to easily change the order of the images in the gallery? Not sure about this and will need discussing

Again, the above would be totally amazing if doable?
