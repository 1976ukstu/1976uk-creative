Website to do list after huge .css transformation and refactoring

Home page
1. Site title top left
  Looks like the site title is in a box with blur bg - FIXED
2. We have -

  - in the top left corner too. This text is behind the 2 site title elements in the top left corner in white and above the gradient background ** I would like to see what having this text would look like if it was located in the bottom left corner? - FIXED


Websites page
1. Same issue with site title as in the Home page. Site titles to be consistent and the same on all pages at the moment. We may look at animated site titles later on. - FIXED
2. Primary Menu button in top left corner to be removed. - FIXED
3. Also looks like there is another site title element behind the one above - FIXED
4. Background colour can be selected on adjustments page
5. The menu looks good in black but needs to be changed, see below menu number.

**This page is looking very nice with the layout all correct and responsive**


Gallery page
1. Same issue with site title as in the Home page. Site titles to be consistent and the same on all pages at the moment. We may look at animated site titles later on. - FIXED
2. Primary Menu button in top left corner to be removed. - FIXED
3. Also looks like there is another site title element behind the one above - FIXED
4. Background colour can be selected on adjustments page
5. The menu looks good in black but needs to be changed, see below menu number.
6. From last session. The floating buttons, the 'Dashboard Pro' button should just say 'Dashboard' and is good and can be left for now but the 'Contact' button can be removed.
7. Upload Images can be removed as it will be on the Dashboard page.
8. The 'Experience the Dashboard panel below the cards container, can we make the same width and responsiveness as the cards container and give the 3 inner cards a bit of Glassmorphism like the square elements under the contact form on the Contact page.
9. Screenshots - 'gallery-odd-items-bottom-page.png' and 'gallery-div-lightbox-content.png' show the strange elements at the bottom of the Gallery page.

**The Lightbox is now working really well with 96% screen size and controls and 'Fullscreen' and 'Download' buttos working really well. This should be layout for Dashboard page 'Edit' and 'Preview' pages. Maybe the 'Fullscreen' button should glow and pulse when in fullscreen mode to indicate exit?**


Contact page
1. Same issue with site title as in the Home page. Site titles to be consistent and the same on all pages at the moment. We may look at animated site titles later on. - FIXED

6. Would be good if it works. Emails reaching cPanel email inbow but not Gmail inbox?

5. The menu looks good in black and needs to be changed and will be the new 'Menu' design, see below menu number.
7. Hamburger needs to be consistent and in same position as the other pages.
8. Layout to match Websites and Gallery pages, full screen and responsive.
9. It needs to be made obvious that the six cards here represent the six cards in the Gallery.
10. On roll-over the cards, the image should fade and some text appear and it should say 'Click to Edit Image!'
11. The click would open the same lightbox design with the image on the left and a side pannel on the right with edit option simillar to when you click the 'Edit' button that is existing now.
12. The 'Show Edited' buttom should be on the right too but just a roll-over action to see the original image.
13. Can we add a 'Crop and Resize' button on the right that will show checkered backgroung where cropped images where.
14. All existing image adjustments should be kept
15. Here we can add the 'Upload new Image' feature and when clicked the imge on the left will be faded and become the upload by drag and drop area and there will also be the click to browse feature here simila to what we have now on the Gallery page when you click on the 'Upload Images' button.
