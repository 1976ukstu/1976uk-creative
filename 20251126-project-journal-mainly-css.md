## 20251126 - Project Journal to list final css improvements


## Home Page
1. I love the site title on this page in the top left hand corner. Can we make this consistent throughout the site as the site title on the other pages looks a bit smaller?


## Gallery Page
1. When we reduce the width of the screen to around 1310px the cards seem to slip of to the right hand side. Breakpoint adjustment?
2. The Gallery sub title to be justified left like it is on the Websites page
3. Gallery modal. Works great but can we have a bit mor padding at the bottom as i loose half of the image and it would be great to have the same spacing top and bottom please?
4. Gallery modal. Can we and a left and right arrow a the top to flick through the other images on the Gallery page please?


## Websites Page
1. When we reduce the width of the screen to around 1150px the cards seem to overlap to slip of to the right hand side. Breakpoint adjustment?
2. Can we increase the main websites title to match the Gallery title and then keep this size for all main page titles
3. Can we see a bit more of the website example on the cards so they match the same visible example as the gallery cards please?


## Contact Page
1. As the new Portfolio Page and Projects Page are looking so good, can we just bring the Contact Page into the same card container consistency? A little bit of width with the main card container and same style layout as Projects and Portfolio Pages


## Projects Page
1. The small 'div.span-concept' bubbles need a little bit of re-positioning
2. The 'Development road map' title can just have a little bit more space above, only a few px just to even out the spacing
