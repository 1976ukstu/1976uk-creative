So here are a few ideas for the contact page 

Im having real tech trouble at the moment and i dont know if it is the wifi or the machine but everything is so slow and difficult to cmunicate.

If i add ideas here, we can talk them over when the connection improves.

1. I love the contact page layout but since the new copyright page was made for Dragica i was hoping we could possibly change the design to be more like the copyright page.

2. The contact could have a link to the developer-portfolio if this is the correct thing to do once it has been adjusted for 1976uk-creative?

3. The emails are reaching my webmail portal in cPanel

the email looks like this -

It would be great to get these emails to my gmail interface if possible

4. There a 229 emails from people or spam i do not know
    Im sure most are spam but how do i tell if they are credible leads for me to follow up on?

5. To add some of the glassmorphism effect i think the text should be on the frosred panels but the background will be just off white with a couple of horizontal stripes running accross it in the same way that the animated gradient works so well on the other pages but pure white stripes of differing thicknesses just like if you hold up a piece of glass and the light moves across it? We can chat about this
