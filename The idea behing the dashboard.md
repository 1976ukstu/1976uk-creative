# The idea behind the dashboard

This idea is for a dashboard that is linked to the website to be used by artists (not inclusive) that have had a wordpress website built by me.
It is useful for people that do not have experience of the WordPress dashboard and need to upload new media without using the WP admin panel.
It was designed when i built my friend a new custom wordpress theme. The original design had 3 galleries on 3 different pages. The pages were 'Paintings', 'Commissions' and 'Small Works'. Towards the end of the build i adapted the design to include the 'Text' page.
My design was to bypass the WP Amin completely with a secure password to enter dashboard that after a few redesigns went to a page with cards for each section. So when the 'Paintings' card was clicked it went to the 'Paintings' dashboard. Here you could see each painting that had been initially added through the Media admin panel. At the bottom of the uploaded images there was an 'Add' and 'Remove' button.
