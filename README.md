# 🚀 1976uk Creative - Professional Portfolio

**The Custom WordPress Foundation for My Freelance Business**
**Status:** Active Development

## 🎨 Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for **1976uk Creative**. This is not just a theme; it is a custom-built digital laboratory designed to showcase my work as a web developer for the creative industries.

I built this theme from the ground up to demonstrate a "clean-code first" philosophy. It avoids heavy page builders in favor of a lightweight, performant, and completely bespoke WordPress architecture.
