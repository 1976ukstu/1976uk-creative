# 🚀 1976uk Creative - Professional Portfolio

**The Custom WordPress Foundation for My Freelance Business**
**Status:** Active Development

---

## 🎨 Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for **1976uk Creative**. This is not just a theme; it is a custom-built digital laboratory designed to showcase my work as a web developer for the creative industries.

I built this theme from the ground up to demonstrate a "clean-code first" philosophy. It avoids heavy page builders in favor of a lightweight, performant, and completely bespoke WordPress architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

### **Custom Architecture**
* **Bespoke Theme Development:** A fully custom theme structure (no pre-bought templates).
* **ACF Integration:** A tailored backend using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to give the user complete control without code bloat.
* **Performance Focused:** Clean CSS architecture and optimized assets for 100/100 Lighthouse scores.
* **Git Workflow:** Professional version control and deployment pipeline.

### **The "Artist Dashboard" (In Development)**
I am currently developing a bespoke "Artist Management Dashboard" within this theme. This allows creatives to manage their galleries and media through a simplified, intuitive UI, removing the complexity of the standard WordPress dashboard.
